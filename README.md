Week 1 Day 5
Learning Activity: Beginning Python Challenge - Putting it all together

Initiated practicing with the turtle library in Trinket.io then eventually migrated this project to VS code.

This Python builtin library showed me how anyone could design colorfull shapes of any size, and it could start with something as simple as a square to a 3 dimensional figure. The code could get repeatitive, therefore using and understanding functions and forloops are very important, and it makes the average code newbie see the instant change therefore getting a better understanding of the differences in the code being applied.
